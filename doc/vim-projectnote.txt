INTRODUCTION                                    *projectnote*

Whenever you edit a file from a Git repository, a set of commands is defined
that serve as a gateway to Git.

COMMANDS                                        *projectnote-commands*

These commands are local to the buffers in which they work (generally, buffers
that are part of Git repositories).

:PNoteOpen                  Checks if project note already exists. If so, opens
                            note on right in :res 40 window.
:PNoteAddTodo {args}        Adds a new todo below the latest. Increments the
                            todo number by 1.
:PNoteAddNote {args}        Adds a new note below the latest. Increments the
                            note number by 1.
:PNoteStrikethrough {args}  Marks the specified note as complete.
